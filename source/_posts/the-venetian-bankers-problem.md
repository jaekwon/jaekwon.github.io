I've been thinking about a consensus protocol that can confirm transactions quickly without using proof-of-work mining as Bitcoin does.

While writing a whitepaper for this protocol I discovered that the problem that Bitcoin aims to solve is a superset of the Byzantine Generals Problem.

I call this problem the Venetian Bankers Problem because it has the additional requirement that all participants act in a greedy, game theoretically optimal way.

Here is a draft of the [whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IIZMYSCUz5x9QKyrQ5QAX8GbGb9VeeyRLXNI29TaKyw/edit?usp=sharing).
